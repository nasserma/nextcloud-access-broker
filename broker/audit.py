"""Append-only, hash-chained audit log (Gate 3).

Goal contract, Gate 3:

- Write-before-operate. record() writes and flushes the entry, and only
  then runs the caller's operation via the `then` callback. If the log
  write fails for ANY reason (disk, permissions, injected fault), the
  callback never runs and LogWriteError propagates. The wall does not
  operate unobserved.
- Append-only, fsync per record.
- Tamper evidence: every record carries prev_sha256, the hash of the
  canonical JSON of the previous record (64 zeros for the first).
  verify_chain() walks the chain and reports the first break, detecting
  truncation, reordering, and edits.
- No secrets: any field containing a configured secret-shaped string is
  rejected with ValueError before it is ever written. The configured
  secrets list is injected by the caller (config, Stage 7); the log
  itself never sees credentials otherwise.
- The clock is injected.

Record format (one JSON object per line, canonical key order):
  {"timestamp": ..., "instance": ..., "path": ..., "operation": ...,
   "grant_id": ..., "decision": ..., "reason": ..., "prev_sha256": ...}

The chain hash is computed over the record WITHOUT prev_sha256, so a
record's own hash does not depend on the chain position of its writer,
and verify_chain() recomputes identically.

Truncation detection: a hash chain alone cannot detect the loss of its
own tail (a shorter chain is internally consistent). So every write also
updates a sidecar checkpoint file (<path>.head) holding the chain head
hash and the line count. verify_chain() compares the log against the
checkpoint; a missing tail is reported as a chain break.
